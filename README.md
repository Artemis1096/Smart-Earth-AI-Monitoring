# Smart Earth AI Monitoring(SEAM)
Leveraging AI-Powered Monitoring to Create a Smarter Planet, Delivering Real-Time Insights for Informed Decisions, and Paving the Way for a Sustainable Future.

## What we do
Smart Earth AI Monitoring(SEAM) uses satellite images and artificial intelligence to observe and analyze the Earthâ€™s surface. It helps detect vegetation health, classify land types like forests, urban areas, and water bodies, and spot early signs of environmental issues such as deforestation or drought. This information is shown on interactive maps to support better decision-making for sustainable development.

## Terminology
 - LULC ( Land Use and Land Cover ) refers to the classification of the Earth's surface based on the physical features (land cover) and the human activities (land use) occurring on it.
 - Vegetation Severity refers to the extent of stress , damage , or degradation in vegetation due to environmental factors such as drought , fire , disease , deforestation , or human activity.
 - NDVI is a satellite-based index used to measure vegetation health and greenness on Earth.
 - Vegetation Density Class refers to the categorization of land areas based on the amount and thickness (density) of vegetation present, usually derived from satellite indices like NDVI.
